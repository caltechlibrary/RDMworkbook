The workbook contains exercises across the data lifecycle, though the range of activities is not comprehensive. Instead, exercises focus on discrete practices within data management that are structured and can be reproduced by any researcher. The book is divided into chapters by phases of the data lifecycle, with one or more exercises in each chapter. Every exercise comes with a description of its importance, notes on how to do the exercise, and the exercise instructions. The workbook is intended as a supplement to existing data management education. If you would like to learn more about the principles of data management, please see the article by Briney, Coates, and Goben K. Briney et al. (2020) or read the book “Data Management for Researchers” K. A. Briney (2015).

Rich and descriptive file names make it easier to search for files, understand at a glance what they contain, and tell related files apart. Screenshot of pdf’s with consistent file names using the convention FirstAuthorLastName_YEAR_ShortTitle.pdf Instructions: This exercise guides researchers through the process of creating a file naming convention for a group of related files. Fill in each section for a group of related files following the instructions; an example for microscopy files is provided. This exercise may be redone as needed, as different groups of files require different naming conventions. This exercise is based on the “File Naming Convention Worksheet” K. A. Briney (2020a). 1. What group of files will this naming convention cover? You can use different conventions for different file sets. Example: This convention will apply to all of my microscopy files, from raw image through processed image.       2. What information (metadata) is important about these files and makes each file distinct? Ideally, pick three pieces of metadata; use no more than five. This metadata should be enough for you to visually scan the file names and easily understand what’s in each one. Example: For my images, I want to know date, sample ID, and image number for that sample on that date. 3. Do you need to abbreviate any of the metadata or encode it? If any of the metadata from step 2 is described by lots of text, decide what shortened information to keep. If any of the metadata from step 2 has regular categories, standardize the categories and/or replace them with 2- or 3-letter codes; be sure to document these codes. Example: Sample ID will use a code made up of: a 2-letter project abbreviation (project 1 = P1, project 2 = P2); a 3-letter species abbreviation (mouse = “MUS,” fruit fly = “DRS”); and 3-digit sample ID (assigned in my notebook).       4. What is the order for the metadata in the file name? Think about how you want to sort and search for your files to decide what metadata should appear at the beginning of the file name. If date is important, use ISO 8601-formatted dates (YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD) at the beginning of the file names so dates sort chronologically. Example: My sample ID is most important so I will list it first, followed by date, then image number. 5. What characters will you use to separate each piece of metadata in the file name? Many computer systems cannot handle spaces in file names. To make file names both computer- and human-readable, use dashes (-), underscores (_), and/or capitalize the first letter of each word in the file names. Example: I will use underscores to separate metadata and dashes between parts of my sample ID.       6. Will you need to track different versions of each file? You can track versions of a file by appending version information to end of the file name. Consider using a version number (e.g. “v01”) or the version date (use ISO 8601 format: YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD). *Example: As each image goes through my analysis workflow, I will append the version type to the end of the file name (e.g. “_raw”, “_processed”, and “_composite”).*       7. Write down your naming convention pattern. Make sure the convention only uses alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores. Ideally, file names will be 32 characters or less. *Example: My file naming convention is “SA-MPL-EID_YYYYMMDD_###_status.tif” Examples are “P1-MUS-023_20200229_051_raw.tif” and “P2-DRS-285_20191031_062_composite.tif.”*       8. Document this convention in a README.txt (or save this worksheet) and keep it with your files.       References Briney, K. A. (2020a).

Do this at the end of the project while you still remember which files are important and where they are located. The Archive folder should only contain a small subset of the most important documents that are likely to be reused; you may still need to go through all of your files but, in the majority of instances, you will save time by easily finding what you need in the Archive folder. Instructions: This exercise consists of a checklist of the key documents that are likely to be most useful in a research project archive. Create a separate folder within the larger project folder (or in a highly visible place within the storage system) labelled “Archive.” Copy – do not move – the files on this checklist into the Archive folder. Add copies other important research documents, as needed. Remember, the Archive folder does not need to be comprehensive, so focus on the subset of files that are most likely to be reused or referenced in the future.
