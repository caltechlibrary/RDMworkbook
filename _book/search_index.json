The workbook contains exercises across the data lifecycle, though the range of activities is not comprehensive. Instead, exercises focus on discrete practices within data management that are structured and can be reproduced by any researcher. The book is divided into chapters, roughly by phases of the data lifecycle, with one or more exercises in each chapter. Every exercise comes with a description of its value within data management, instructions on how to do the exercise, original source of the exercise, and the exercise itself. The workbook is intended as a supplement to existing data management education. If you would like to learn more about the principles of data management, please see the article “Foundational Practices of Research Data Management” (K. Briney et al., 2020) or read the book “Data Management for Researchers” (K. A. Briney, 2015). Beta Edition The Research Data Management Workbook is currently in the beta edition, meaning I’m still tweaking the exercises and trying to catch stray typos. I’m more than happy to receive any feedback on the Workbook to improve it. You can message me at briney@caltech.edu.

But for how ubiquitous the lab notebook is, documentation can sometimes be lacking. The ideal laboratory notebook allows someone with similar training as you to be able to follow everything you did in your research. This exercise prompts you to review an old entry within your laboratory notebook to evaluate if your documentation is sufficient for reproducing your work. Instructions: You will need a laboratory notebook entry from 6-12 months ago to do this exercise. Once you have the entry, read through it to try to understand what you did on that day. Answer the exercise questions to evaluate the entry and identify any note keeping improvements to make. Date of lab notebook entry being evaluated: ____________________ Read the entry and summarize the work you did on that date:       How easy was it to understand what you did from your notes? Could you reproduce your work solely from the information in your notes?       What worked well with your note keeping?       What would you improve about your note keeping?       List one change you plan to make to take better research notes:       2.2 Write a Project-Level README.txt Description: Data files living on a computer often need extra documentation for someone to understand what research they correspond to. In particular, it is useful to record the most basic project information and store it in the top-level folder of each research project. This can be done with a README.txt. The name, “README,” indicates that the file conveys important information and the file type, TXT, can be opened by many different software programs, making the content maximally accessible. This exercise walks you through the key information needed in a project-level README.txt file. The same information can also be recorded at the front of a physical laboratory notebook. Instructions: Pick a research project and answer the following questions. Copy all of the text into a TXT file and save it with the name “README.txt.” Store this file in the top-level of the project folder on your computer, alongside the project files. Source: This exercise was adapted from the “Project Close Out Checklist” (K. A. Briney, 2020b). What is the title of the project?       What is the project description?       What is the time period the project was done over?       Who worked on the project?       Where are the files are stored?       How are files organized? Are any naming conventions used and, if so, what are they (see Chapter 3)?       2.3 Create a Data Dictionary Description: Ideally, a spreadsheet is formatted with a row of variable names at the top, followed by rows of data going down. This makes easy for data to be used in any data analysis software (interoperability is a good thing) but makes it impossible to document a spreadsheet within the file itself. For this reason, it’s useful to create a data dictionary to describe the spreadsheet so that others can interpret the data. This exercise walks you through the major information you should record for each variable in the spreadsheet, adding up to a complete dictionary to accompany the spreadsheet file. Instructions: Fill out the question in each row for each variable in the spreadsheet; note that you will likely have more variables than columns in this table. Copy this information into a text document and save it next to the spreadsheet. It is useful to save the data dictionary with the same root name as its data file by appending “_dictionary” on the end of the file name; for example, the data dictionary for the file “myData.xlsx” would be “myData_dictionary.txt.” Source: This exercise was adapted from the “Leveling Up Data Management” (K.

Well-organized files make it easier to find the data you need without spending lots of time searching your computer. Every researcher organizes their files slightly differently, but the actual organizational system is less important that having a place where all of your files should logically go. This exercise prompts you to brainstorm organizational grouping and hierarchies to come up with an order for managing your research data. Instructions: This is a card-sorting exercise, meaning you will need a stack of note cards or post-it notes to do this activity. Follow the instructions to label cards and move them around until you develop your organizational system. There is no one correct way to do this so feel free to play around, add new cards, and move cards however you want! Once you put your new organizational system into place, be sure to always put your files where they’re supposed to go. Take a stack of notecards or post-it notes and write the following labels on them, omitting any file types that you do not use in your research: Raw data Analyzed data Code Protocols Article drafts Figures Your publications Literature PDFs Grant documents Research notes Move cards around and group together files that you want to store together. Create hierarchies in organization, such as for organizing files by project or by date, by adding new “folder” cards and moving existing cards/groups of cards underneath them. Label these new cards as appropriate. Make copies of any cards, as needed, and adjust placement and hierarchies until you are happy with the organizational system you developed. Record your organizational system in your lab notebook or in a README.txt. 3.2 Create a File Naming Convention Description: File naming conventions are a simple way to add order to your files and help to find them later. Rich and descriptive file names make it easier to search for files, understand at a glance what they contain, and tell related files apart. Screenshot of pdf’s with consistent file names using the convention FirstAuthorLastName_YEAR_ShortTitle.pdf Instructions: This exercise guides researchers through the process of creating a file naming convention for a group of related files. Fill in each section for a group of related files following the instructions; an example for microscopy files is provided. This exercise may be redone as needed, as different groups of files require different naming conventions. Source: This exercise is based on the “File Naming Convention Worksheet” (K. A. Briney, 2020a). 1. What group of files will this naming convention cover? You can use different conventions for different file sets. Example: This convention will apply to all of my microscopy files, from raw image through processed image.       2. What information (metadata) is important about these files and makes each file distinct? Ideally, pick three pieces of metadata; use no more than five. This metadata should be enough for you to visually scan the file names and easily understand what’s in each one. Example: For my images, I want to know date, sample ID, and image number for that sample on that date. 3. Do you need to abbreviate any of the metadata or encode it? If any of the metadata from step 2 is described by lots of text, decide what shortened information to keep. If any of the metadata from step 2 has regular categories, standardize the categories and/or replace them with 2- or 3-letter codes; be sure to document these codes. Example: Sample ID will use a code made up of: a 2-letter project abbreviation (project 1 = P1, project 2 = P2); a 3-letter species abbreviation (mouse = “MUS,” fruit fly = “DRS”); and 3-digit sample ID (assigned in my notebook).       4. What is the order for the metadata in the file name? Think about how you want to sort and search for your files to decide what metadata should appear at the beginning of the file name. If date is important, use ISO 8601-formatted dates (YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD) at the beginning of the file names so dates sort chronologically. Example: My sample ID is most important so I will list it first, followed by date, then image number. 5. What characters will you use to separate each piece of metadata in the file name? Many computer systems cannot handle spaces in file names. To make file names both computer- and human-readable, use dashes (-), underscores (_), and/or capitalize the first letter of each word in the file names. Example: I will use underscores to separate metadata and dashes between parts of my sample ID.       6. Will you need to track different versions of each file? You can track versions of a file by appending version information to end of the file name. Consider using a version number (e.g. “v01”) or the version date (use ISO 8601 format: YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD). Example: As each image goes through my analysis workflow, I will append the version type to the end of the file name (e.g. “_raw,” “_processed,” and “_composite”).       7. Write down your naming convention pattern. Make sure the convention only uses alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores. Ideally, file names will be 32 characters or less. Example: My file naming convention is “SA-MPL-EID_YYYYMMDD_###_status.tif” Examples are “P1-MUS-023_20200229_051_raw.tif” and “P2-DRS-285_20191031_062_composite.tif.”       8. Document this convention in a README.txt (or save this worksheet) and keep it with your files.       References Briney, K. A. (2020a).

This document describes how data will be actively managed during a project and may be updated whenever necessary to reflect current data practices. A living DMP is a useful touchstone for understanding where data lives, how it’s labelled, how it moves through the research process, and who will oversee the data management. This exercise guides you through the process of creating a living DMP for your research. Instructions: Pick a project and answer the following questions to build your living DMP. This DMP may be changed at any time to improve practices. If you are doing collaborative research, work through this exercise with your collaborators to agree on shared conventions. Write a short summary of what project this DMP is for:       How will your data be organized? (See Exercise 3.1: Set Up a File Organization System.)       What naming convention(s) will you use for your data? (See Exercise 3.2: Create a File Naming Convention.)       Where will data be stored? How will data be backed up? (See Exercise 4.1: Store and Back Up the Data.)       How will you document your research? Where will your research notes be stored?       How will data move through the collection and analysis pipelines?       Do you need to do any version control on your files? How will that be done?       As necessary, record any project roles and responsibilities around data management:       5.2 Determine Data Stewardship Description: It is often helpful to be up front about requirements and permissions around research data. This exercise encourages you to discuss these issues with supervisors and peers to make sure that there are no misunderstandings about who has what rights to use, retain, and share data. Instructions: Determine which research data should be discussed. Bring together the Principle Investigator, the researcher collecting the data, and anyone else who works with that data. As a group, answer the questions in the exercise, making sure that everyone agrees on the final decisions. Record the results of the discussion and save them with the project files. Source: This exercise was adapted from the “Project Close Out Checklist” (K. A. Briney, 2020b). What data do these agreements apply to?       Are there security or intellectual property restrictions on the data and, if so, what are they?       Are there any requirement to publicly share the data and, if so, what are they?       Who will store the copy of record of the data and for how long?       Who is allowed to keep a copy of the data after the project ends? Which data?       Who is allowed to reuse the data after the project ends? Are there any requirements for reuse, such as co-authorship?       Who keeps any physical research notebooks after the project ends?       References Briney, K. A. (2020b).

This checklist exercise walks you through steps to gather your data into a central place and document the project. Working through the checklist results in project data being in one central location, well documented, and organized and formatted in a way to make future reuse easier. Instructions: Gather all of the data from a project and work through the checklist to organize and document the data for future reuse. This exercise refers to several other exercises in the Workbook that should be completed during this process, if they have not been already Source: This exercise was adapted from the “Project Close Out Checklist” (K. A. Briney, 2020b). Prepare Data □ Move all data into one central project folder; this folder may have sub-folders and should be organized however makes sense for your data. □ As necessary, work through Exercise 7.2: Convert Data File Types to copy data into more open/common file formats. Back Up Your Research Notes □ If your notes are electronic, save a copy in the project folder □ If your notes are physical, scan them and save a copy in the project folder. Create a Project Archive Folder □ Work through Exercise 7.3: Create an Archive Folder. □ Put the Archive folder in the project folder. Create a Project-Level README File □ If you haven’t done so already, work through Exercise 2.2: Project-Level README.txt. □ Store a copy of the README file with the data. Save Files in a Stable Location □ Save the project folder on a storage system that you will have access to for the next several years. 7.2 Convert Data File Types Description: Data is often stored in a file type that can only be opened by specific, costly software – this is referred to as a “proprietary file type.” You can tell that you have data in a proprietary file type if you lose access to the data when you lose access to the software. When data is in a proprietary file type, it’s always a good idea to copy the data into a more common, open file type as a backup; you may lose a bit of functionality, but it’s better to have a backup than to not have your data at all! This exercise works through identifying possible alternative file types for the data’s proprietary file type before instructing you to make a copy of the data in the new file type. Instructions: For any data in a proprietary file type, identify the data and answer the following questions. Once you have picked a more open, common file type, make a copy of the data in that file type but do not delete the original data. Is your data stored in a proprietary file type? What file type and how does this limit future data reuse?       Is it possible to convert your data to other file types? If so, list the possible types:       Which of the possible file types are in common use? Which of the possible file types can be opened by multiple software programs?       Of the possible options above, do you have a preference for a specific file type?       Pick one of the more open or common file types and copy your important data files into that file type. Do not delete the original files.       7.3 Create an Archive Folder Description: To save your future-self time spent digging through all of your research files, set aside the most important files into a separate “Archive” folder. Do this at the end of the project while you still remember which files are important and where they are located. The Archive folder should only contain a small subset of the most important documents that are likely to be reused; you may still need to go through all of your files but, in the majority of instances, you will save time by easily finding what you need in the Archive folder. Instructions: This exercise consists of a checklist of the key documents that are likely to be most useful in a research project archive. Create a separate folder within the larger project folder (or in a highly visible place within the storage system) labelled “Archive.” Copy – do not move – the files on this checklist into the Archive folder. Add copies other important research documents, as needed. Remember, the Archive folder does not need to be comprehensive, so focus on the subset of files that are most likely to be reused or referenced in the future. Source: This exercise was adapted from the “Project Close Out Checklist” (K. A. Briney, 2020b). Project Documentation □ README file of project information Data Snapshots □ Raw data □ Key data analyses □ Final data Code □ Analysis code □ Record software version, as appropriate Other Research Documents □ Protocols □ Survey instruments Research Notes □ Scan of research notebook □ Digital notes Images □ Flat files of figures (e.g. .JPG or .TIFF) □ Editable image files (e.g. Photoshop) Publications □ Published article in .PDF format □ Final version of the article in editable document format (e.g. .DOCX) □ Posters Administrative Documents □ Grant proposals □ Grant progress reports and final report 7.4 Separate from the Institution Description: Researchers regularly leave institutions in order to take new jobs. For how common this occurrence is, it represents a critical transition during which data may be lost. This checklist enumerates a number of important steps that researchers can take to ensure that they retain the appropriate data yet leave behind what belongs to the institution. Instructions: The researcher leaving the institution should work through this checklist to ensure they keep the proper information while returning what does not belong to them. The researcher and project administrator may also jointly work through the extended version of this exercise, the Data Departure Checklist (Goben &amp; Briney, 2023).
