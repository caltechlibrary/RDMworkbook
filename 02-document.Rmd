## Project-Level README.txt {#readme-txt}

***Description:*** *Data files living on a computer often need extra documentation for someone to understand what research they correspond to. In particular, it is useful to record the most basic project information and store it in the top-level folder of each research project. This can be done with a README.txt. The name, "README", indicates that it conveys important information and the file type, TXT, can be opened by many different software programs, making the content maximally accessible. This exercise walks you through the key information needed in a project-level README.txt file. The same information can also be recorded at the front of a physical laboratory notebook.*

***Instructions:*** *Pick a research project and answer the following questions. Copy all of the text into a TXT file and save it with the name “README.txt”. Store this file in the top-level of the project folder on your computer, alongside the project files.*
