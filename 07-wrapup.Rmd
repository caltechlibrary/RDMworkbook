**Prepare Data**

Prepare data:

&#9633; Convert data to more open/common file formats (e.g. .CSV or .TXT) 


**Create a Project-Level README File**

Work through [Exercise 2.2: Project-Level README.txt](#readme-txt).

Store a copy of the README file with the data.


## The Archive Folder {#archive-folder}

***Description:*** *To save your future-self time spent digging through all of your research files, set aside the most important files into a separate “Archive” folder. Do this at the end of the project while you still remember which files are important and where they are located. The Archive folder should only contain a small subset of the most important documents that are likely to be reused; you may still need to go through all of your files but, in the majority of instances, you will save time by easily finding what you need in the Archive folder.*

***Instructions:*** *This exercise consists of a checklist of the key documents that are likely to be most useful in a research project archive. Create a separate folder within the larger project folder (or in a highly visible place within the storage system) labelled “Archive”. Copy – do not move – the files on this checklist into the Archive folder. Add copies other important research documents, as needed. Remember, the Archive folder does not need to be comprehensive, so focus on the subset of files that are most likely to be reused or referenced in the future.*
