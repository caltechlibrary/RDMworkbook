# Project Wrap Up

## Prepare Data for Future Use {#future-use}

***Description:*** *The end of a project is a good time to prepare data for potential future reuse, as you still know the important details about the data to record and have access to any software used to create the data. This checklist exercise walks you through steps to gather your data into a central place and document the project. Working through the checklist results in project data being in one central location, well documented, and organized and formatted in a way to make future reuse easier.*

***Instructions:*** *Gather all of the data from a project and work through the checklist to organize and document the data for future reuse. This exercise refers to several other exercises in the Workbook that should be completed during this process, if they have not been already*

**Prepare Data**

&#9633; Move all data into one central project folder; this folder may have sub-folders and should be organized however makes sense for your data.

&#9633; As necessary, copy data into more open/common file formats; see [Exercise 7.2: Convert Data File Types](#file-type).

**Back Up Your Research Notes**

&#9633; If your notes are electronic, save a copy in the project folder

&#9633; If your notes are physical, scan them and save a copy in the project folder.

**Create a Project Archive Folder**

&#9633; Work through [Exercise 7.3: Create an Archive Folder](#archive-folder).

&#9633; Put the Archive folder in the project folder.

**Create a Project-Level README File**

&#9633; Work through [Exercise 2.2: Project-Level README.txt](#readme-txt).

&#9633; Store a copy of the README file with the data.

**Save Files in a Stable Location**

&#9633; Save the project folder on a storage system that you will have access to for the next several years.



## Convert Data File Types {#file-type}

***Description:*** *Data is often stored in a file type that can only be opened by specific, costly software – this is referred to as a “proprietary file type.” You can tell that you have data in a proprietary file type if you lose access to the data when you lose access to the software. When data is in a proprietary file type, it’s always a good idea to copy the data into a more common, open file type as a backup; you may lose a bit of functionality, but it’s better to have a backup than to not have your data at all! This exercise works through identifying possible alternative file types for the data's proprietary file type before instructing you to make a copy of the data in the new file type.*

***Instructions:*** *For any data in a proprietary file type, identify the data and answer the following questions. Once you have picked a more open, common file type, make a copy of the data in that file type but do not delete the original data.*

**Is your data stored in a proprietary file type? What file type and how does this limit future data reuse?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Is it possible to convert your data to other file types? If so, list the possible types:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Which of the possible file types are in common use? Which of the possible file types can be opened by multiple software programs?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Of the possible options above, do you have a preference for a specific file type?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Pick one of the more open or common file types and copy your important data files into that file type. Do not delete the original files.**

## Create an Archive Folder {#archive-folder}

***Description:*** *To save your future-self time spent digging through all of your research files, set aside the most important files into a separate “Archive” folder. Do this at the end of the project while you still remember which files are important and where they are located. The Archive folder should only contain a small subset of the most important documents that are likely to be reused; you may still need to go through all of your files but, in the majority of instances, you will save time by easily finding what you need in the Archive folder.*

***Instructions:*** *This exercise consists of a checklist of the key documents that are likely to be most useful in a research project archive. Create a separate folder within the larger project folder (or in a highly visible place within the storage system) labelled “Archive”. Copy – do not move – the files on this checklist into the Archive folder. Add copies other important research documents, as needed. Remember, the Archive folder does not need to be comprehensive, so focus on the subset of files that are most likely to be reused or referenced in the future.*
