# Data Sharing

Sharing data that underlies research has become a common expectation within scholarly research. However, the landscape of data repositories is still uneven and many researchers are still learning best practices for data sharing. To help in this area, this chapter offers of two exercises: a decision tree-inspired worksheet for picking the best data repository for your data; and checklist for working through the process of sharing data in a data repository.

## Pick a Data Repository {#data-repository}

***Description:*** *It can be difficult to know where to share research data as so many sharing platforms are available. Current guidance is to deposit data in data repository that will give you a DOI. This exercise guides you through the process of picking a data repository, starting with repositories for very specific types of data and defaulting to generalist data repositories. Note that some repositories charge fees for deposit, most often for large data (500 GB or larger).*

***Instructions:*** *Identify the data that needs to be shared and work through repository selection from discipline-specific data repositories to more general data repositories. Once you have identified a repository for all of your data, the exercise is over and you do not need to answer any further questions. Note that, depending on data types, you may need to deposit your data into multiple repositories (for example, a discipline-specific repository for one type of data and an institutional data repository for the rest of the data).*

![Workflow diagram upon which the exercise is based. Starting at the top, decide is there is a known disciplinary data repository (if so, deposit data), a logical disciplinary data repository (if so, deposit data), an institutional data repository (if so, deposit data), and if none of those work pick a generalist data repository.](images/06_Repository.jpg)

**Identify all of the data that needs to be shared.**

*Example: My data to be shared includes: 1) genetic data for Drosophila; and 2) microscope images of flies.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Is there a known disciplinary data repository for some or all of the data? For example, is there a data repository used by everyone in your research area or required for your data type by your funding agency?**

If so, deposit some or all of your data there. End the exercise if the repository will accept all of your data or keep going if there is still some data left to deposit.

*Example: The database [FlyBase](http://flybase.org/) is used for Drosophila genes and genomes. My genetic data will be shared there.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Review the [list of recommended data repositories from PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories). Is there a logical disciplinary data repository for some or all of your data?**

If so, deposit some or all of your data there. End the exercise if you have shared all of your data or keep going if there is still some data left to deposit.

*Example: There isn't a logical disciplinary data repository for microscope images of flies.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Does your institution have a data repository?**

If so, deposit the remainder of your data there and end the exercise.

*Example: The California Institute of Technology has the data repository [CaltechDATA](https://data.caltech.edu/). I will deposit my microscope images in CaltechDATA.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Do you have a preferred [generalist data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/generalist-repositories)?**

If so, deposit the remainder of your data there and end the exercise.

*Example: (All data has been shared already.)*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Pick a [generalist data repository](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/generalist-repositories) and deposit the remainder of your data.**

*Example: (All data has been shared already.)*

## Share Data {#share-data}

***Description:*** *Data sharing is becoming common and expected by funding agencies and journals. While the process of depositing data into a data repository will vary between repositories, there are some common actions that should be taken to prepare data for sharing. This exercise walks you through these standard requirements for sharing data.*

***Instructions:*** *This checklist enumerates the necessary steps and decisions to deposit data supporting a research article into a data repository. Identify the data to be shared and work through the list. Note that, if data will be shared as multiple deposits or in multiple repositories, the checklist should be worked separately for each group of data.*

**Data Selection**

\_\_ Select the data files that reproduce published results.

\_\_ Perform quality control on the data files.

\_\_ Convert data in proprietary file types to open file types, as appropriate (see [Exercise 7.2: Convert Data File Types](#file-type)).

\_\_ Determine if data will be shared in one group or as several deposits. If there will be multiple deposits in one repository or data will be divided across more than one data repository, work through the remainder of the checklist separately for each group of shared files.

**Data Documentation**

\_\_ Document any spreadsheet data with a data dictionary (see [Exercise 2.3: Create a Data Dictionary](#data-dictionary)). The data dictionary should be shared with the other files.

\_\_ Write a brief description of each data file, including any data dictionaries, and what it contains. Save this information as a README.txt file and share it with the other files.

**Sharing Information (Metadata)**

\_\_ Give the data set a title. Default title is “Data from: [name of the article]”.

\_\_ Write a brief description of the data set to be used as the abstract/description.

\_\_ Determine who will be listed as authors of the data and in what order; this may be different than the authors of the article.

\_\_ Chose a license for reuse. Default license is CC0 (for more information on CC0, see [@creative_commons_wiki_cc0_2014]).

**Deposit Data**

\_\_ Pick a data repository for the shared data (see [Exercise 6.1: Pick a Data Repository](#data-repository)).

\_\_ Deposit the data and documentation files into the data repository, and fill in metadata as determined above.

**Share Data**

\_\_ Share data with its DOI.

\_\_ Link the publication to its data, either in a Data Availability Statement or as a citation.
