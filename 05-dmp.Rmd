## Determine Data Stewardship {#data-governance}

***Description:*** *It is often helpful to be up front about requirements and permissions around research data. This exercise encourages you to discuss these issues with supervisors and peers to make sure that there are no misunderstandings about who has what rights to use, retain, and share data.*

***Instructions:*** *Determine which research data should be discussed. Bring together the Principle Investigator, the researcher collecting the data, and anyone else who works with that data. As a group, answer the questions in the exercise, making sure that everyone agrees on the final decisions. Record the results of the discussion and save them with the project files.*

***Source:*** *This exercise was adapted from the "Project Close Out Checklist" [@briney_project_2020].*
