	abstract = {The importance of research data has grown as researchers across disciplines seek to ensure reproducibility, facilitate data reuse, and acknowledge data as a valuable scholarly commodity. Researchers are under increasing pressure to share their data for validation and reuse. Adopting good data management practices allows researchers to efficiently locate their data, understand it, and use it throughout all of the stages of a project and in the future. Additionally, good data management can streamline data analysis, visualization, and reporting, thus making publication less stressful and time-consuming. By implementing foundational practices of data management, researchers set themselves up for success by formalizing processes and reducing common errors in data handling, which can free up more time for research. This paper provides an introduction to best practices for managing all types of data.},

	abstract = {The Data Departure Checklist (DDC) helps research teams and individuals plan for when a team member is leaving a project, lab, team, or institution. By providing a series of prompts for the departing personnel (DP) and a project administrator (PA) to review and check off, use of the DDC encourages successful planning for transition and will, ideally, prevent data loss or misunderstandings about data ownership and use or future reuse. The DDC can also be used in the event of an unexpected departure of a team member in order to transfer documents prior to the DP’s ID expiration and machines being wiped, and to prompt others to confirm that access to data storage and all relevant physical or digital locations has been removed. This document is intended to facilitate conversations between the DP and the primary investigator and/or the institution in order to provide customizable standardized guidance to facilitate transitions. It should serve only as a supplement to any legal or contractual obligations between the individual and the institution.},

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a researcher in possession of data must be in want of better data management. Good data management means spending less time searching for old data files, always remembering the details of each experiment (because you wrote them down), and never losing your work even if your hard drive crashes. This talk highlights several fundamental data management practices that you can integrate into your research processes that will make it easier to find, use, and manage your data years into the future.},

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
