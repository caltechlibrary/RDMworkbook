	abstract = {The importance of research data has grown as researchers across disciplines seek to ensure reproducibility, facilitate data reuse, and acknowledge data as a valuable scholarly commodity. Researchers are under increasing pressure to share their data for validation and reuse. Adopting good data management practices allows researchers to efficiently locate their data, understand it, and use it throughout all of the stages of a project and in the future. Additionally, good data management can streamline data analysis, visualization, and reporting, thus making publication less stressful and time-consuming. By implementing foundational practices of data management, researchers set themselves up for success by formalizing processes and reducing common errors in data handling, which can free up more time for research. This paper provides an introduction to best practices for managing all types of data.},

	abstract = {The Data Departure Checklist (DDC) helps research teams and individuals plan for when a team member is leaving a project, lab, team, or institution. By providing a series of prompts for the departing personnel (DP) and a project administrator (PA) to review and check off, use of the DDC encourages successful planning for transition and will, ideally, prevent data loss or misunderstandings about data ownership and use or future reuse. The DDC can also be used in the event of an unexpected departure of a team member in order to transfer documents prior to the DPâ€™s ID expiration and machines being wiped, and to prompt others to confirm that access to data storage and all relevant physical or digital locations has been removed. This document is intended to facilitate conversations between the DP and the primary investigator and/or the institution in order to provide customizable standardized guidance to facilitate transitions. It should serve only as a supplement to any legal or contractual obligations between the individual and the institution.},
